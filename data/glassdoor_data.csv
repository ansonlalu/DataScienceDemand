Imagine a job where you...
Work directly with senior managers on a regular basis
Have a meaningful impact on the mission-critical products and services that clients rely on every single day
Collaborate with colleagues across business lines and regions
At Ipreo, this is true for EVERY MEMBER of our global organization! Our technology solutions and analytical insights are relied upon by every major investment bank and thousands of corporations around the world.

Ipreo is seeking experienced candidates with investor knowledge that can make an immediate impact providing clients with investor insights. Additionally, this role provides the opportunity to manage & train analysts on the team. The Corporate Analytics group works closely with clients in the investor relations function at publicly-traded companies. The role is client facing, and you will develop direct client relationships as well as assist clients with topics that have a visible impact on high-level decision making; often used in presentations to the c-suite and board of directors of our clients' companies.

While analytical in nature, our goal is to provide insight and intelligence to assist clients, rather than just provide data. Analysts are exposed to diverse subject matter ranging from fundamental analysis, capital markets activity, and analyzing shareholder behavior. Given the focus of our clients and their needs, the team operates in a fast-paced environment where quality and accuracy is just as important as a timely response.

The ability to multitask is critical, as well as working well as a team to accomplish responsibilities. In addition to supporting clients, the Corporate Analytics group serves as a subject matter expert and analytical resource to internal groups on topics such as corporate capital allocation policy, shareholder behavior around transactions such as M&A and spinoffs.

Given the diversity of subject matter and direct client interactions, the Corporate Analytics role is a unique opportunity to gain broad exposure to topics driving financial markets, while at the same time gaining a specialty in knowledge of the institutional investment community and shareholder behavior.

What you'll work on:
Collaborate with team members and maintaining existing client relationships
Analyzing the flow of institutional capital and providing actionable intelligence on investor behavior
Servicing clients with timely market, fundamental and shareholder information
Producing scheduled deliverables and ad hoc reports in a timely and accurate fashion
Utilizing datasets and information from both internal and external applications

2-5 years of experience
Experience with Capital Markets and/or Institutional Investors
Previous financial and analytical experience
Superior analytical reasoning, oral and written communication skills

In addition, new regulations - domestic and international - are placing a greater emphasis on the effectiveness of internal controls, and this often requires independent assurance.
